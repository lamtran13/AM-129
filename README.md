1. Homework 4 \
Use python to examine some basic features of a couple gene sequences. One is the reference genome for SARS-Cov-2, one is the genome of a more recent variant, and the final genome is for a Norovirus. The latter two sequences wonâ€™t be labeled. Compare them against the SARS-Cov-2 genome to figure out which one is which.
